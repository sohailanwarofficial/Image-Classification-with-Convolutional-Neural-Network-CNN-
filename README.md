# Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This project demonstrates how to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. The CNN model is trained on a dataset of images, and the training process is visualized with accuracy and loss graphs. This README provides an overview of the code and its usage.

## Overview

The code provided in this script includes the following steps:

1. Mounting Google Drive to access training and testing datasets.
2. Setting up data generators for image preprocessing and augmentation.
3. Creating a CNN model with convolutional and pooling layers.
4. Compiling the model with an optimizer and loss function.
5. Training the model on the training dataset.
6. Visualizing the training progress with accuracy and loss graphs.
7. Saving the trained model and visualization graphs.

## Getting Started

Before running the code, ensure that you have:

1. Training and testing datasets organized in separate directories ('Training' and 'Testing').
2. Python, TensorFlow, and Keras installed.
3. Sufficient GPU resources for training if working with a large dataset.

## Customization

You can customize the code to fit your specific requirements:

1. Adjust the batch size, image dimensions, and number of classes to match your dataset.
2. Experiment with different CNN architectures, layers, or hyperparameters.
3. Modify the optimizer and loss function to suit your classification task.

## Performance

The code trains a CNN model for image classification tasks. The performance of the model depends on factors such as dataset size, model complexity, and the quality of data preprocessing and augmentation.

## Saving Model and Graphs

The trained CNN model is saved in an h5 file format, which can be loaded for inference or further fine-tuning. The accuracy and loss graphs are saved as images for visualization.

Please ensure that your dataset is correctly organized and labeled before running the code. If you have any questions or encounter issues, feel free to reach out for assistance.
