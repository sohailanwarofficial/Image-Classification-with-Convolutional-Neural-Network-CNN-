# Image-Classification-with-Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN-
This project demonstrates how to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. The CNN model is trained on a dataset of images, and the training process is visualized with accuracy and loss graphs. This README provides an overview of the code and its usage.
